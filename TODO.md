## Next Task(s)

- SOMETHING to do next

## Backlog & Ideas

- Create a simple web service that returns data
    - Include tests, test reporting, and test coverage reporting
    - Use TypeScript, Express, and TypeORM
- Create SQLite data and test data that can be used depending on if the service is running versus if it is tested
- Add an Oracle19c container to the solution
- Migrate the web service to use the Oracle database, but still use SQLite for testing
